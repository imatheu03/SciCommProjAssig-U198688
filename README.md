## Abstract

The limitations of current computation and artificial intelligence approaches have led to the emergence of biological computation, which has been studied in recent years as an alternative to traditional computation methods. The NeuChiP European project aims to develop a proof-of-concept for a biological computing AI device. This thesis investigated different culture setups using both primary cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons as a first step towards biological computation. The cultures were recorded using calcium imaging, and the results were analyzed from a network perspective to study activity and connectivity. The findings indicated that culture functional connectivity could be configured through physical constraints, chemical agents affecting synaptic transmission, and mechanical agents like random cuts, which had a direct effect on network activity and connectivity. However, the cultures eventually adapted to external changes due to the inherent plasticity of biological neuronal networks, highlighting the need for effective and durable stimulation methods. Reproducing results with primary cultures using iPSC-derived cortical neurons was challenging but essential for future studies in the biological computing research field.

Keywords: Biological computation, artificial intelligence, in vitro neuronal cultures, network analysis, human iPSC, cortical neurons.

## Preface or Prologue

One of the most fascinating aspects of my Biomedical Engineering Degree is the multidisciplinary nature of the subjects, teachers, and knowledge we acquire. Therefore, I eagerly sought a final bachelor's project that embraced this multidisciplinary approach, and the NeuChip European project provided the perfect opportunity. The project's central theme, biological computation, captivated my interest, as attempting to mimic brain functions with real biological neurons in the lab represented a complex and ambitious objective for my thesis.

The NeuChip project is a collaborative effort among entities from various European institutions, including Aston University, University of Barcelona, Loughborough University, French National Centre for Scientific Research, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and 3Brain AG company from Switzerland. Each entity has distinct roles and defined objectives within the project, ranging from in silico work in modeling biological neural networks to cellular differentiation and chemical work in building microscale plastic patterns. Despite our diverse academic backgrounds and specific objectives, we collaborate and work together on discussions and major decisions. In fact, just weeks before submitting this thesis, I had the honor of actively participating in the project's first annual face-to-face meeting in Barcelona.

As a biomedical engineer, I was able to provide a broad perspective on the project's feasibility and the interconnection of different components, bridging the computational and biological realms. This is also why I had two supervisors, as I aimed to incorporate both computational and experimental work into this thesis to make it as comprehensive as possible, reflecting the role of a biomedical engineer.

Furthermore, I would like to emphasize the significance of biological computation. Alongside the examples presented in this thesis, it is important to note that the NeuChip project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, underscoring the academic research interest in biological computation. Industry stakeholders are also invested in this field, exemplified by the inclusion of 3Brain, a company involved in the NeuChip project, and the European Union's mid-term objective of creating a spin-off company.

## State of the Art

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become integral to various fields, with significant global impact. Neural networks, a key AI technology, have played a crucial role in the AI revolution. Initially, AI research explored both symbolism and connectionism, but connectionism prevailed due to its efficiency and effectiveness. However, current AI systems have limitations such as unsustainable energy consumption and the need for extensive computing power. To overcome these constraints, the NeuChip project aims to develop a biological computation alternative inspired by the human brain. It seeks to use human neural networks as low-power computing components, surpassing conventional artificial neural networks in adaptability and performance. The University of Barcelona is involved in shaping network self-organization and training as part of the project. In vitro neuronal cultures are being studied to build high-capacity AI systems with modest energy consumption and self-organization. Challenges include recreating the rich spatiotemporal activity patterns of native tissue and inducing patterning in the connectivity of neuronal cultures. Such biological computation has vast potential, including applications in medical therapies and studying neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroengineering with in vitro neuronal cultures enables the exploration of network architecture and dynamics in disease research and transplant therapies.
